A DAY WITH BEETHOVEN
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
At daybreak, on a summer
morning, in the year 1815, a short,
thick-set, sturdily-built man
entered his sitting-room, and
at once set to work to compose
music.  Not that he disturbed
the slumbers of the other inhabitants by
untimely noises upon the pianoforte: a course
which, at three in the morning, might be
resented by even the most enthusiastic admirer
of his genius.  No: he sat down at his table,
with plenty of music paper, and addressed
himself to his usual avocation of writing
assiduously till noon or thereabouts.
</p>

<p>
The untidy, uncomfortable condition of
his room did not distress Ludwig van
Beethoven in the least.  True, it was scattered
all over with books and music; here the
remains of last night's food, there an empty
wine bottle; on the piano, the hasty sketch of
some immortal work; on the floor, uncorrected
proofs, business letters, orchestral scores, and
MSS. in a chaotic pile.
</p>

<p>
But he thoroughly enjoyed casting a
glance, from time to time, at the sunny scene
without; at the vista towards the Belvedere
Garden, the Danube, and the distant
Carpathians,&mdash;the view for the sake of which
he had taken up his lodgings at this house in
the Sailer-stätte, Vienna.  For if there was
one thing which still could afford a unique
and cloudless pleasure to this sensitive,
unhappy man, it was Nature in all her varied
forms of light and loveliness.  Nature, that
"never did betray the heart that loved her,"
still held out open arms of help and solace
for the healing of his afflicted soul.
</p>

<p>
Beethoven, in his various migrations from
lodging to lodging&mdash;and they were very
numerous, and inspired by the most trivial
causes&mdash;always endeavoured to select an airy,
sunshiny spot, where he could at least feel
the country air blowing to him, and so keep
in touch with his beloved green fields.  If the
supply of sunshine proved insufficient, that
was quite a valid reason for another removal.
But his restless, sensitive mind was apt to
magnify molehills into mountains, and the
most trifling inconvenience into a serious
obstacle to work.  Work was his starting
point, his course, his goal; work was his whole
<i>raison-d'-être</i>, the very meaning and object
of his existence.
</p>

<p>
It has been observed that if we would
represent to ourselves a day in the life of
Beethoven, one of the Master's own wonderful
compositions would serve as the best counterpart.
Wagner instances the great Quartet in C
sharp minor as a notable instance of this
allegoric music,&mdash;designating the rather long
introductory <i>Adagio</i>, "than which, probably,
nothing more melancholy has ever been
expressed in tones, as the awaking of a day
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Which through its tardy course<br />
  No single longing shall fulfil&mdash;not one!'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And yet the <i>Adagio</i> is in itself a prayer, a period
of conference with God, in faith, in eternal
goodness."  And it was in a state of mind which
one may term unconsciously devotional, that
the great composer now ascended into regions
where few could follow him,&mdash;where, his senses
deaf and blind to earthly sights and sounds, he
could hold intercourse with a pure and celestial
art.  For Music contains, within its inexhaustible
treasuries, not only all that we conceive of
best, all those highest and most ennobling
emotions which thrill us as at a touch of the
Divine finger, but it also possesses all the
characteristic beauties of other arts.  The
composer shares Form and Colour with the
painter&mdash;a much more elastic variety of
Form&mdash;and an incomparably wider use of Colour, in
the magnificent paintbox of the orchestra.  The
composer's art, moreover, is not stationary at
one fixed point&mdash;one moment, so to speak,
seized and immortalised upon canvas: but has
the fluidity and onward movement of actual life,
passing with bewildering rapidity of transition
from one phase of thought to another, even as
life does.  And the composer, while he shares
with the great prose writer and the poet the
power of expressing things marvellously well,&mdash;of
uttering in beautifully poised and balanced
rhythm the whole gamut of human emotion,&mdash;yet
has a greater power than theirs.  For he
can put into a single phrase, with an exquisite
intimacy of intuition, a meaning which could
hardly be denoted in a hundred words: he can
condense into a couple of bars the essence of a
whole chapter.
</p>

<p>
The outward appearance was far from beautiful,
which belied the really lofty heart of the
great composer as he sat indefatigably at work.
His thick, dark, upstanding hair, already
turning grey, crowned a pitted, swarthy face;
his looks were rugged, gloomy, forbidding;
his chin bore evidence of the most superficial
shaving; his hands were covered with thick
black hair; his small, deeply set, fiery eyes
alone redeemed him from ugliness.  For the
rest, he had cotton wool in his ears, and his
rough, shabby, hairy clothes gave him a
Crusoesque look, almost comic in its
incongruity with his occupation.
</p>

<p>
The housekeeper brought in his breakfast:
he paid no attention to her.  He had
punctiliously counted out sixty coffee-beans
overnight, and handed them to her in readiness
for the morning; but now, after he had dipped
his pen in the coffee-cup instead of the ink
some three or four times, he pushed away the
discoloured mixture, and absently nibbled his
crusty roll.  He was composing a <i>Polonaise</i>,
to be dedicated to the Empress of Russia,
for which he was to receive fifty ducats.
This seemed an absurdly small remuneration,
but although Beethoven was "really forced"
(to quote Richard Wagner) "to support
himself from the proceeds of his musical labours,"
yet, as life had no allurements for him in
the ordinary sense, he had less necessity laid
on him to make much money; and "the more
confident he became in the employment of
his inner wealth, so much the more confidently
did he make his demands outward; and he
actually required from his benefactors, that
they should no longer pay him for his
compositions, but so provide for him that he
might work altogether for himself, unconcerned
as to the rest of the world.  And it really
happened&mdash;a thing unprecedented in the lives
of musicians&mdash;that a few benevolent men of
rank pledged themselves to keep Beethoven
independent in the sense demanded."
</p>

<p>
So it was not with any misgivings that
he set aside the score of the <i>Polonaise</i>, still
unfinished, and turned to something which he
justly regarded as holding promise of his best
vocal work; that which is still, perhaps, the
greatest love-song in the world&mdash;the unequalled
<i>Adélaide</i>.  Its words, though above the average
of the German lyrist of that period, served
merely as a peg upon which to hang the
music.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Lonely strays thy friend in April's garden,<br />
  Lovely fairy lights around are gleaming<br />
  Through the tremulous boughs of rosy blossom,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adélaide!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">

  In the dying day all gold-beclouded,<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  Evening breezes through the leaves are lisping,<br />
  Silver May-bells in the grasses chiming,<br />
  Waves are rustling, nightingales are fluting&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adélaide!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Soon, O wonder! on my grave a floweret,<br />
  From the ashes of my heart upspringing,<br />
  Shall reveal, on every purple petal&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adélaide!"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Matthisson</i>.)<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Beethoven had qualified himself for vocal
writing to a degree which is rarely attempted
by the instrumental composer.  Although his
father and grandfather had been vocalists, his
own early studies had been in other branches
of music; he knew little of the capabilities
of the voice.  So he took singing lessons from
the Italian composer Salieri; and
notwithstanding that his own voice was shrill and harsh,
increasingly so as his deafness grew upon
him, he was thus enabled to pour forth liquid
and melodious phrases, such as those of
<i>Adélaide</i>, which seem so absolutely adapted
to the requirements of a singer that they could,
so to speak, sing themselves.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Adélaide</i>," he said, "came entirely from
my heart;" and therefore its pure ardour
goes straight to the heart of the hearer.  But
he was not contented with his work, upon
which he had already spent much time and
thought.  A frown gathered heavily upon his
overhanging brows, as, humming the air and
playing an imaginary accompaniment on the
desk, he went over it again and again in
the endeavour to "gild refined gold."
</p>

<p>
"The more one achieves in art," he
grumbled, "the less contented is one with
former works."  And this, indeed, was
characteristic of Ludwig van Beethoven: never
to be satisfied with what he had accomplished,
but to go on continually, as it were, from
strength to strength.  That "divine discontent
which is at the root of all improvement,"
perpetually impelled him towards higher
things, and made him at once haughtily
conscious of his own powers, and yet the most
modest and laborious of men.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Adélaide</i>, however, lay hidden more
than the fluent outcome of his creative instinct.
It remains the lovesong for all time&mdash;the last
word of a noble and ennobling passion.
Here&mdash;to pursue the simile of the C sharp minor
quartet&mdash;a dream-image of the <i>Allegro</i>
awakened in charming reminiscence and played
sweetly and sorrowfully with itself.  For
this rough, rugged, eccentric, bad-tempered
musician was capable of reaching the austerest
heights of love&mdash;those heights where
renunciation sits eternally enthroned.
</p>

<p>
Love and Beethoven seem a singularly
anomalous pair: yet from his youth onward
love was the very mainspring of his unsullied
life.  It began, rooted in filial affection for his
mother, of whom he wrote those touching
words, "She was such a good, loving mother
to me, and my best friend.  Oh, no one could
be more fortunate than I, when I was able to
speak that sweet name 'Mother', and it was
heard&mdash;and to whom shall I ever say it
now?"&mdash;And it continued as a vague but fervent
longing for some sweet unknown&mdash;some "not
impossible She."
</p>

<p>
"Love, and love alone, is capable of
bringing lasting happiness .... O God,
let me find her&mdash;<i>her</i>&mdash;who will strengthen me
in virtue and lawfully be mine."
</p>

<p>
So he sighed: but his hopes remained
unfulfilled.  "His intense longing for a home
and for female companionship was never
satisfied," and the extraordinary number of
attachments by which his career was punctuated,
and which were generally for women of
superior rank to his own, were every one
of them destined to be transitory and destitute
of result.  Magdalena Willmann, Giulietta
Guicciardi, Bettine Brentano, Thérèse von
Brunswick, Amalie Sebald, and many another
charming phantom, passed, fugitively brilliant,
across his horizon: and the domestic happiness
for which Beethoven never ceased to crave,
was never within measurable distance of his
grasp.
</p>

<p>
But now he resolutely put away <i>Adélaide</i>
and its attendant wistful thoughts, and
addressed himself to more severely intellectual
work: the great B flat Sonata (Op. 106) which,
like all his latter work, is orchestral in feeling
and treatment.

<p class="caption">
"The Scherzo of the 'Moonlight' Sonata,
wherein a troop of glimmering fairy forms come
dancing through the midnight forest."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Beethoven was primarily and permanently
a composer of sonatas; for "the great
majority and most excellent of his
instrumental compositions, the fundamental
form of the sonata was the veil-like tissue
through which he gazed into the realm of
tones, or, also, through which, emerging from
that realm, he made himself intelligible to
us&mdash;while other forms, the mixed ones of
vocal music especially, were, after all, only
transitorily touched upon by him, as if by
way of experiment."  (Wagner.)
</p>

<p>
And one has only to reflect upon the
magical and matchless beauty of his best-known
work in sonata form, to be surrounded at once
by a multitude of gorgeous memories.  The
opening movement of the "Pathétique,"
transfused with gloomy majesty; the <i>Scherzo</i> of the
"Moonlight" Sonata, wherein a troop of
glimmering fairy forms come dancing through the
midnight forest: the magnificent verve and
vigour of the "Waldstein:" and that
unapproachable <i>Andante</i> of the "Appassionata,"
which some have declared they would wish
to hear in dying, that the solemn glory of its
pensive chords might companion them into
the rest of God .... These, and innumerable
other instances, each dear to the individual
heart, identify Beethoven as the true lord of
the Sonata.
</p>

<p>
The reader will doubtless feel some
wonder that all this while the master was
composing so rigorously at his desk, leaving
the pianoforte untouched.  But there were
three very adequate reasons for this mode
of action.  First&mdash;that he was in the habit
of writing everything, as he composed it, in
notebooks; mostly out of doors in solitary
rambles away from any instrument, where
he would "hum to himself, and beat
the air with an accompaniment of
extraordinary vocal sounds."  Secondly&mdash;that,
being a consummate master of the science of
music, and the best pianist, perhaps, of his
day, he had no occasion to put to proof in
actual performance, as the amateur does, the
constructions of his fertile brain.  Thirdly&mdash;and
chiefly, and sorrowful to relate&mdash;when
he had just been composing, his deafness
for a while would deepen into stone-deafness:
and "because of the inner world of harmony
at work within his brain," said Bettine
Brentano, "the external world seemed all
confusion to him."  Beethoven's greatest works,
as years went on, were "conceived,
produced and given complete to the world
... when not one of those wondrous succession of
of phrases could by any possibility reach his
ears:" when, in a "splendid isolation" beyond
the average power to understand, he and
Music dwelt alone in an inner shrine together.
"Never has an earthly art created anything
so serene as the symphonies in A, and
F major, and all those works of the Master
which date from the period of his complete
deafness."
</p>

<p>
It is therefore open to doubt whether an
affliction, which in an ordinary man would
command our pity, was so much to be
deprecated in the case of Ludwig van Beethoven
as at first thoughts one might imagine.  He
was full of self-commiseration on its account:
yet assuredly the compensations which were
awarded him were such as never before fell
to mortal man.  By the entire exclusion of
external sounds, and the entire concentration
of his mind upon his work, which resulted,
he was enabled to enter those unexplored
altitudes whither none has followed, as none
had preceded him.  "He elevated music
(which had been degraded, as regards its
proper nature, to the rank of a merely
diverting art), to the height of its sublime
calling."  And it must be remembered that
his works were very much more remarkable,
as offsprings of the early nineteenth century;
than they now appear to us who are familiar
with them,&mdash;to us, who are heirs of the
progress of composition.  For Music is the
youngest of all the arts,&mdash;as compared to all
others, a mere babe in arms, whose potentialities
and possibilities are still but in the bud.
And that Beethoven should stand where he
does, on a pinnacle that none may deny, is one
more proof of that isolation of genius which
makes him twin with Shakespeare.  These
columnar intellects rise like obelisks in the
midst of the ages: not to be accounted for by
any rule of circumstance, or education, or
heredity: and "What Beethoven's melodies
produce, Shakespeare's spirit-shapes also
project."
</p>

<p>
So absorbed was the master in the elaboration
and evolution of his "tone-poem," that he
did not see, much less hear, the timid entrance
of a very shy young man.  It was one Charles
Neate, an English pianist, who had come,
armed with a letter of introduction, to beseech
the great Beethoven to receive him as a pupil
for the piano.
</p>

<p>
The great Beethoven was for a moment
inclined to be exceedingly bearish and
inhospitable.  To come on a morning when he was
busy&mdash;to interrupt a man in the full flow of
composition&mdash;these were unpardonable crimes!
But soon his native kindliness prevailed&mdash;above
all, when he discovered that his visitor was of
"the noble English nation."  For he held
England and the English to be of an incomparable
excellence: and his darling wish was to
visit that favoured land, and to win a hearing
there, and if possible secure an offer from some
London publishing firm.
</p>

<p>
He, therefore, accepted the young man
with unwonted graciousness and alacrity:
looked through his compositions and gave him
sound advice: and finally, thrusting away his
own MSS., proposed that they two should take
a little walk, to get a breath of fresh air before
further operations.  They passed out into the
sunlit fields.
</p>

<p>
Never in all his life had Neate met a man
so wholly taken up with nature, so enwrapt
with the contemplation of trees, flowers, cloud,
and sward.  "Nature seemed his nourishment,"
Neate said afterwards.  "He seemed to live
upon and by her."  The parable of the <i>Presto</i>
of the C sharp minor Quartet, here was
openly fulfilled,&mdash;the master, rendered, from
within, completely happy, cast a glance of
indescribable serenity upon the outer world.
There it once more stands before him as in
the Pastoral Symphony: everything is rendered
luminous to him by his inner happiness.
</p>

<p>
They seated themselves upon a grassy
bank, and Beethoven discoursed freely of
the things dearest to his heart: his keen
desire to visit England, and his fear lest
his deafness might prove a hopeless obstacle to
this.  Neate, speaking to him in slow German,
close to his left ear, managed to make himself
intelligible; while the master expressed his
unbounded admiration for everything English,
especially Shakespeare, who was his favourite
poet.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Beethoven was, indeed, as has been
observed, "precisely like Shakespeare in his
bearing towards the formal laws of his art, and in
his emancipation from and penetration of them."  He
stood, as has previously been shown, nearer
in point of genius to Shakespeare than to any
other man: and verified the truth of Schumann's
dictum that "all arts are reducible to one," and
are guided by the same fundamental rules.
</p>

<p>
After a brief but exhilarating ramble in
the open air, Beethoven proposed that Neate
should return to dinner with him, and after
that should&mdash;perhaps&mdash;receive his first lesson.
The young man was overwhelmed at such
unexpected kindness and <i>camaraderie</i> as he was
receiving from the master, and gratefully
accompanied him back to the city.
</p>

<p>
Before going to the Sailer-stätte, however,
Beethoven turned into Steiner's, the music
publisher's, which he was in the habit of
frequenting about noon-day; where there was
"nearly always a little crowd of composers,
and a brisk interchange of musical opinion."
(Hättenbrenner).
</p>

<p>
Beethoven was to-day in a genial and
expansive frame of mind.  Possibly the advent
of a young Englishman had struck him as a
good omen for the fulfilment of his cherished
hopes towards English fame.  He held forth
at considerable length, upon all manner of
subjects, from music to philosophy.  "His
criticisms were ingenuous, original, full of
curious ideas" and boundless imagination.
Finally, at the reiterated request of those he
most favoured among the younger men, he
reluctantly consented to play&mdash;to exemplify, as
they cunningly put it, the opinions which he had
been urging, and the laws he had been laying
down.
</p>

<p>
Now, listeners on either side of a door&mdash;in
or out&mdash;were, as it has been said, Beethoven's
chief aversion.  Pianoforte virtuoso as he was,
fine performer on the organ, violin, and
viola&mdash;anything that savoured of professional
display was nauseous to him.  "Music the art
was for him the breath of life: music the
profession, as generally understood," he
relegated to the depths of distaste.
</p>

<p>
He sat down with a shrug of his square
shoulders, and, crooking his fingers to such a
degree that his hands almost hid them,
continued for a moment his tirade against the
prevalent methods of playing.
</p>

<p>
"How did the old composers who were
pianists, play?" he asked of his audience.
"They did not run up and down the keyboard
with their carefully-practised passages&mdash;<i>putsch,
putsch, putsch</i>!"&mdash;and he worked the runs in a
caricatured passage on the pianoforte.
</p>

<p>
"When true virtuosi played, it was comprehensive,
complete....  Good, thorough
work one could look into and examine....
But I pronounce judgment on no one," he
added hastily, and forthwith burst into the full
splendour of the <i>Waldstein</i> sonata.
</p>

<p>
His passion, his prodigious strength, amazed
the Viennese, accustomed as they were to hear
him, no less than the young Englishman, to whom
he appeared a very prodigy of execution, as his
broad, hairy, spatulate fingers, so unlike those
of the typical pianist, flung themselves hither
and thither upon the keys.  He produced tones
and effects which were hitherto undreamed of
in the philosophy of the pianists of that period;
and it was evident that this was no mere display
of virtuosity, but that Beethoven had lost
consciousness of all around him, and was simply
giving vent to his own inspiration, as one
possessed might do.  And among the impressionable
hearers, moved beyond self-control, soon
not a dry eye was to be seen.  Many broke
into sobs; but when they would have crowded
round the master, with the ultimate chord, to
express in vehement gestures their boundless
admiration, he rose with an almost shamefaced
air, as though he had debased himself by this
semi-poetic performance, and shuffled away,
beckoning Neate to follow him.
</p>

<p>
The two dined alone in Beethoven's apartment
in the Sailer-stätte, at his wonted time of
two o'clock.  The composer was not superior
to creature comforts, and was very particular
to have certain dishes on certain days.  On
Thursdays he invariably indulged in his favourite
bread-soup, made with ten eggs.  On Fridays
he had a large haddock, with potatoes.  A little
Hungarian wine, or a glass of beer, sufficed him;
but his favourite beverage was plenty of cold
water.  Water, in fact, was a necessity to
him, and he rejoiced ecstatically in bathing,
washing, splashing about in water; in pouring
it recklessly over his hands and arms; water,
internally or externally, may be said to have
been his chief necessity of life.
</p>

<p>
Upon this especial occasion, the table&mdash;still
littered with MSS.&mdash;was graced by Beethoven's
favourite dish of macaroni and cheese, and a
small dish of fish.  Somewhat Spartan fare
this for an Englishman; but Charles Neate
was much too excited to care what he was
eating.
</p>

<p>
Beethoven never composed in the afternoon,
and very seldom in the evening.  He had
hardly sat still after dinner, smoking his long
clay pipe, when&mdash;"Let us go out into the
country," said he, suddenly springing up.
Neate's possible piano lesson had vanished
from his mind.  He stuffed one or two
extra note-books into his capacious pockets,
and they started off&mdash;this time in a different
direction.
</p>

<p>
This habit of suddenly rushing out into
the open air he practised at all seasons, as
the fancy took him: cold or heat, rain or
sunshine, made no difference to him whatever.
He had found that only among the silent
solitudes of the hills and valleys could he fully
release that throng of insurgent ideas which
for ever clamoured in his brain for an outlet.
Melodies, subjects, suggestions for their
development and execution, flocked continuously
through his mind; and to set them down in
feverish haste&mdash;to imprison their "first fine
careless rapture" in his note-book, for
subsequent improvement and enlargement, was
the occupation of all these country walks.
But, consciously or unconsciously, his restless
mind was soothed, and his sensitive nerves
strengthened by the tranquil influences of the
winds and skies.
</p>

<p>
Beethoven pursued his usual course on the
present occasion, pulling out his note-book
every few minutes, his lips moving rapidly,
his eyes riveted on some mysterious distance.
But he made an obvious effort at entertaining
his young companion; and presently, Neate,
encouraged by an unwonted stretch of
conversation, or rather monologue, ventured to
remark upon the master's great power in
creating tone-pictures, and of the landscape-drawing,
so to speak, of the Pastoral Symphony,
wherein the green fields of Paradise seem to
expand before earth's weary eyes, and there is

<p class="poem">
  "Know'st thou the house, its roof on columns white? ....<br />
  O there, O there, might I with thee, Beloved, go!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Beethoven testified that, when composing,
he always had a vision of natural beauty before
his eyes, and that it enabled him to work.  He
had never been out of his native land: the
lovely Austrian villages which he frequented,
Hetzendorf, Dobling, or Heiligenstadt, sufficed
him for beauty and for healthiness.  But now
and then, he allowed, he had a momentary
longing for other scenes: the ice-blue mysteries
of the Alps, or the warm and fragrant air of
Italy.  And he quoted&mdash;singing in a harsh,
crude voice&mdash;those words of Goethe's which
he had linked with such enchanting music,&mdash;the
words of Mignon, yearning towards the
homeland of her heart.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Know'st thou the land, where sweet the citron blows,<br />
  Where deep in shade the golden orange glows?<br />
  A tender breeze from bluest heav'n doth stray<br />
  O'er myrtle bough and lofty laurel spray.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know'st thou it well? that land dost know?<br />
  O there, O there, might I with thee, Beloved, go!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Know'st thou the house, its roof on columns white?<br />
  Fair gleams the hall, the hearth is glimmering bright;<br />
  And marble statues ask, with glances mild,<br />
  'What have they done to thee?  O say, poor child!'<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know'st thou it well? that house dost know?<br />
  O there, O there, might I with thee, Beloved, go!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Know'st thou the crag, and all its cloudy grey,<br />
  Where scarce the muleteer may grope the way?<br />
  In caverns lurk the dragon's ancient brood,<br />
  Sheer falls the rock, and over it the flood.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know'st thou it well? the way we know&mdash;<br />
  O there, O there, my father, let us go!"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Göethe&mdash;<i>Wilhelm Meister</i>.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The composer at last turned homeward
once more, and on arrival at his rooms, without
a word of preparation, took young Neate by
the shoulders and placed him upon the three-legged
chair before the pianoforte.  The chair
promptly broke; but, nothing disconcerted, the
master replaced it with another almost equally
crippled, and bade the young man play.
</p>

<p>
It may be imagined with what diffidence,
what nervousness, and what sinking of heart,
the Englishman essayed the <i>Sonata Pathétique</i>.
He paused, breathless, at the conclusion, and
awaited the verdict with anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"My son," said Beethoven, clapping him
on the shoulder, "you will have to play a very
long time before you discover that you know
nothing.  But cheer up! for the young there
are infinities of hope."  And he proceeded,
with inconceivably kind care and patience, to
give the youth such teaching as he had never
imagined possible.  That 'bitter, sarcastic'
tongue of which folk complained, that irritable
temper which often alarmed the master's young
lady pupils&mdash;were now conspicuously absent.
For he had a peculiar sympathy with young
people at the outset of their career; and no
trouble was too great for him to take on their
behalf.
</p>

<p>
When at length, with cordial words of
encouragement, he dismissed the Englishman,
Beethoven for a moment was tempted to look
back upon his own early days; when, always
working very hard, either as a performer or a
teacher, surrounded by unloving relations and
uncongenial circumstances, he struggled upward,
ever upward, impelled by some irresistible wind
of destiny.  Then he dwelt, involuntarily,
upon the gathering clouds of his manhood&mdash;the
secret dread of his encroaching deafness&mdash;the
hidden sorrows of unrequited love.
</p>

<p>
"Such things," he thought, "have often
brought me to the border of despair, and I have
come very near to putting an end to my own
life.... Yet it seemed impossible to quit
this world for ever before I had done all that
I felt I was destined to accomplish ... and
how much of that is still before me!  Ah! hard
struggle to accomplish all which remains to be
done, from the daily drudgery of necessity-work
to the farthest journey, the highest flight! ... All
this must be hewn out of thyself ... for
thyself there is no further happiness than that
which thou findest in thyself&mdash;thy art!"
(<i>Beethoven's Diary</i>).
</p>

<p>
But now, with the coming of the evening
hours, the composer might relax the tension of
his thoughts, and find pleasure, so far as his
infirmity allowed, in the society of his friends,
and in talking over the newspapers.  He was a
well-read man, and took an eager interest in all
the passing events of the day; moreover, when
not in his 'serious working humour', he was a
humorous, cheerful companion, full of fun and
not averse from practical joking; a very
different man from that 'savage personality, at
loggerheads with mankind,' which he had
appeared to the unsympathetic Goethe.  For
'friends,' however, we had better substitute
'acquaintances'; because Beethoven declared:
"I have only found two friends in the world
with whom I have never had a misunderstanding.
One is dead; the other still lives.
Although we have heard nothing of each other
for six years, I know that I still hold the place
in his affections that he holds in mine."
</p>

<p>
A decided irascibility and uncertainty of
temper, common to all deaf people, was apt to
create rifts and coolnesses between Beethoven
and those with whom he might be closely
intimate.  His whole warmth and abundance of
affection was squandered upon his nephew Carl,
the worthless son of a worthless father; an
affection by no means reciprocated, which was
fated only to cause fresh pangs to his
much-enduring heart.
</p>

<p>
But, be that as it may, the Viennese were
proud of their Beethoven&mdash;proud to be
numbered among his associates.  They bore him a
species of personal attachment.  He was part
and parcel of themselves; though he moved
in their midst, doubly remote from them, alike
by his affliction and by his open distaste for
'the dissipations of a great and voluptuous
city.'   He would sit apart at a table, brooding
over a long pipe and a glass of lager, his eyes
half-closed; but if anyone spoke to him, or
rather attempted to do so, he would always
reply with ready courtesy and kindness.  For,
as he had written from the very depths of his
heart:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"O ye who think or say that I am rancorous,
obstinate or misanthropical, what an
injustice you do me!  You little know the
hidden cause of my appearing so.  From
childhood my heart and mind have been devoted to
benevolent feelings, and to the thoughts of
great deeds to be achieved in the future....
Born with an ardent, lively temperament, fond
of social pleasures, I was early compelled to
withdraw myself, and live a life of isolation
from all men.  At times, when I made an
effort to overcome the difficulty, oh, how cruelly
was I frustrated by the doubly painful
experience of my defective hearing! ... Forgive
me, then, if you see me turn away when I
would gladly mix with you.  Doubly painful is
my misfortune, seeing that it is the cause of my
being misunderstood.  For me there can be no
recreation in human intercourse, no conversation,
no exchange of thoughts with my fellow-men.
In solitary exile I am compelled to live."
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, however, his naturally vivacious
spirits prevailed, and he became witty, satirical,
'a fellow of infinite jest.'  Anything in the way
of bad music was apt to send him into shouts of
laughter; but "of Handel, Bach and Mozart
he always spoke with the greatest reverence,
and, although he would not allow his own
great works to be depreciated, he himself
made fun of his lesser productions.  If greatly
roused, he would let loose a perfect flood of
hard-hitting witticisms, droll paradoxes and
ideas."  (<i>Rochlitz.</i>)
</p>

<p>
Still, albeit generous to a fault, and ready
to give away his last thaler even to an enemy,
his dislikes were so violent that he would
actually take to his heels at the sight of some
special object of aversion.
</p>

<p>
With particularly favoured friends, in the
privacy of their own homes, Beethoven was
less reticent than usual.  He would discuss
with them his two great regrets&mdash;that he had
never visited England and had never married;
which were his favourite topics of conversation.
It is true that at forty-five&mdash;his present
age&mdash;these regrets might still have time to be
obliterated.  But he felt himself the very
Simeon Stylites of music, set apart to suffer
in ascetic endurance upon a pillar of aloofness
and despair.
</p>

<p>
And it was in this melancholy frame of
mind&mdash;a reaction from the transient mirth of
the evening&mdash;that the master buttoned his old
grey coat about him and trudged gloomily
homeward as the evening star first lighted
itself.  "O God, Thou lookest downward on
my inward soul!" he murmured, "Thou
knowest, Thou seest that love for my fellow-men,
and all kindly feelings have their abode
there! ... But I have no real friends; I must
live alone.  But I know that God is nearer to
me than to many others in my art, and I
commune with Him fearlessly."
</p>

<p>
Drawing a scrap of paper towards him, he
scrawled a few heartfelt words upon it by the
last rays of twilight:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I must praise Thy goodness that Thou
hast left nothing undone to draw me to Thyself.
It pleased Thee, early, to make me feel the
heavy hand of Thy wrath, and by many
chastisements to bring my proud heart low.
Sickness and other misfortunes hast Thou
caused to hang over me, to bring my straying
from Thee to my remembrance....  But one
thing I ask of Thee, my God&mdash;not to cease Thy
work in my improvement ... Let me tend
towards Thee, no matter by what means&mdash;and
be fruitful in good works...."
</p>

<p>
And Ludwig van Beethoven had a means
of "communing fearlessly" with his Creator,
which, for him, was perhaps, as direct a road
as prayer, if <i>laborare est orare</i>.  For music,
"although in its glorious fulness and power at
that time unknown, was associated intimately
by the early Christian writers with
Christianity&mdash;with immortality."  As Wagner has
declared, music is of the "essential nature of
things, and its kingdom is not of this world...
Its spirit, like that of Christianity, is love."  And
by this medium, and in this divine language,
the man whose outward senses were being
darkened, now held, in the rapture of the
"inward light," his intercourse with celestial
things.
</p>

<p>
Baulked and baffled by circumstances&mdash;dragged
at the chariot-wheels of relentless Fate&mdash;shut
up and shut off from all sweet human
amenities, the tone-artist sat down at his piano,
and "after preluding softly with one hand
... poured out his soul in a very flood of
harmony."  At first the strains were mournful, sombre,
disconnected, his own sad thoughts bearing a
perpetual burden to him.
</p>

<p>
"O Providence," so he prayed, "let one
more day of pure joy be vouchsafed to me!
The echo of true happiness has so long been a
stranger to my heart!  When, when, O God! shall
I again be able to feel it in the temple of
nature and of man?  Never?  No!  O, that
were too hard!"
</p>

<p>
But presently he became buried in a deeper
abstraction; a sphinx-like calm settled on, and
smoothed out, his harsh, rough features.  With
the ease and firmness of a brilliant executant&mdash;with
the intense feeling of an inspired artist, he
continued to improvise the most glorious music
which had issued that day from either his brain
or his fingers.  It was, like the <i>Allegro Finale</i> of
the C sharp minor Quartet, "the dance of the
world itself: wild delight, the lamentation of
anguish, ecstasy of love, highest rapture, misery,
rage, voluptuousness and sorrow."  This great
gift of extemporising, (which was only paralleled
by his equal skill in sight-reading) was at once
the solace and the snare of Beethoven.  Hours
upon hours could thus be dreamed away; yet
who shall say that they were wasted?  For
gradually, out of the shifting panorama of
rhythm and sound, a supreme and marvellous
melody evolved itself.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p>
For a long time&mdash;months, if not years&mdash;he
had been pursuing, as it were, some beautiful,
elusive phantom&mdash;the idea contained in Schiller's
stirring lines commencing:&mdash;"<i>Freude, schöner
Götterfunken</i>," ("<i>Joy, thou heavenly spark of
Godhead</i>").  He was consumed with the desire
to give these lines a worthy setting; he had
filled a multitude of note-books with rough
sketches; but the authentic, the indubitable
melody which should be recognised at first
hearing as the only one, had still evaded him
until now&mdash;now, when he filled the twilight with
a cry of success.
</p>

<p>
"I have it!  I have it!" he exclaimed, as
those magnificent phrases which were to be the
crown and consummation of the great Ninth
Symphony, at last were crystallised into shape
upon his brain.  And at that moment he entered,
as it were, upon a new world of light, "in the
soil of which bloomed before his sight the
long-sought, divinely-sweet, innocently pure melody
of humanity."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Joy, thou heavenly spark of Godhead!</i>"  Was
it the irony of Fate that made this thought the
highest pinnacle of Beethoven's marvellous
achievements?  Was it not rather one of those
divine compensations by which Heaven bestows,
with both hands lavishly, "above all that we
can desire or deserve?"
</p>

<p>
Scintillations of that "heavenly spark,"
multiplied a million-fold, flashed across the
mental vision of the inspired composer;
incessant majesties of sound piled themselves in
splendid strata upon his intellectual ear; until,
"blinded with excess of light," and outwearied
with the exuberance of a joy beyond all that
earth could yield, Ludwig van Beethoven
sought his meagre straw mattress and thin
quilt, and&mdash;while the clocks struck ten in the
city&mdash;fell asleep as softly as a child.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
